/**
 * The com.github.assisstion.Communicator.relay API contains classes to
 * enable programmers to easily connect from one Socket to another and to
 * provide custom functionality associated with the sockets. Each package
 * that is labeled with a letter of the alphabet is a stand-alone package
 * that depends only on packages with a letter closer to the beginning of
 * the alphabet, which all eventually depend on this package. Each package
 * later in the alphabet provide higher-level programming functionality
 * than the previous, allowing programmers to choose feasibility, flexibility,
 * or a mixture of both when working with the API. This API is still being
 * updated, so not all interfaces are in their final form. Feel free to
 * extend any class to provide your own additional functionality.
